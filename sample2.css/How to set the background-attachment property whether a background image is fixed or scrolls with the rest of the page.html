    <h1>ABOUT TIGER</h1>
<pre>Tigers in India constitute more than 70% of the global population of tigers.[1][2] Tiger is officially adopted as the National Animal of India[3] on recommendation of the National Board for Wildlife[4] since April 1972.[5] In popular local languages, tigers are called baagh, puli or sher.[6] The Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris [NCBI:txid74535])[7] is the species found all across the country except Thar desert region, Punjab and Kutch region.[8] These can attain the largest body size among all the Felidae,[6]: 29  and therefore are called Royal Bengal Tigers. Skin hides measuring up to 4 meters are recorded.[9] The body length measured from its nose to the tip of the tail can reach up to 3 meter and it can weigh up to 280 Kilogram with male being heavier than the female. The average life expectancy is about 15 years.[10] However, they are known to survive for up to 20 years in wild.[11] It is solitary and territorial. Tigers in India usually hunts chital (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), barasingha (Cervus duvacelii), wild buffalo (Bubalis arnee) nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and gaur (Bos gaurus) and other animals such as the wild pig (Sus scrofa) for prey and sometimes even other predators like leopards and bears.[10] There are instances of Elephant calves (Elephas maximus) hunted by tigers.[12]

        The tiger is estimated to have been present in India since the Late Pleistocene, for about 12,000 to 16,500 years.[13][14][15] Tigers are found in 20 states[16] of India with a variety of habitats including grasslands, mangrove swamps, tropical and sub-tropical forests,[10] as well as shola forest systems and from plains to mountains over 6000 feet.[17] The tiger is classified as Endangered in the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species.[18] Tigers throughout the Asia are found across 12 regional tiger conservation landscapes (TCLs), of which India is home to 6 global priority TCLs for long-term tiger conservation significance which harbors more than 60% of the global genetic variation in the tiger species.[17]: 6 
        
        India is one of the Founding members of the intergovernmental platform of Tiger Range Countries – Global Tiger Forum[19]: 4  headquartered in New Delhi.[20]: 5  With a global share of 17% human population and 18% livestock population within 2.4% land area of the world, India has successfully managed to conserve the single largest population of free ranging wild tigers in the world effectively trying to reverse a century of decline.[19]: 2  Several initiatives in the form of amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, creating the "National Tiger Conservation Authority", delineating inviolate Core Areas in Tiger Reserves and incentivised voluntary relocation program, among many others have been critical in securing the survival of key tiger populations, the biodiversity, and the ecosystem services of the forests they inhabit.[21] The Project Tiger Division under Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is dedicated for conservation efforts in a scientific way using advanced technological tools.[22] The Government of India increased the budget allocation for tiger conservation from INR 185 crore in 2014 to INR 300 crore in 2022.[19]: 3 . India is committed to secure the livelihoods of its citizens while simultaneously minimizing its impact on its wildlife conservation goals.[21] In 2022, 54th tiger reserve in India was declared in Ranipur Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttar Pradesh, it being the State's fourth tiger reserve.[23]
        
        Tigers are present in different landscapes across the country. Some landscapes are having rich and viable population with adequate habitat and abundance of prey. Then are some landscapes which are prone to human interference but have potential to support improved tiger population. Unfortunately, there are some habitats where once thriving tiger population has now disappeared.[24] As of 2020, it is estimated that nearly 30% of tiger population in India is present outside the Tiger Reserves.[25] While other tiger range countries with relatively more economic prosperity have failed to protect this endangered species, India has lived up to its global commitment for tiger conservation and achieved the target of doubling its population (TX2) ahead of the set time-frame. Despite all the odds ranging from population stress to the demands of development and livelihoods, India has successfully managed to achieve the fine balance between modernization and conservation owing to the people's traditional, cultural and religious tolerance to all forms of life that cohabit with them.[17]

        Characteristics
        Tiger is a large, heavy bodied Cat with dominant shade of reddish-orange (pale yellow ochre to burnt sienna) and black stripes arranged irregularly, with a coat of smooth short hair. The ventral parts with chin, throat, breast and belly are generally white on colour with black stripes. In some tigers, brows and cheeks can also be white. Males have prolonged whiskers. Tigers in the plains tend to grow bigger in size compared to those in hilly areas. Tigers measuring up to 12 feet were often recorded a century ago.[12]: 375  A full grown male can reach 10 feet in length. British Naturalist Robert Armitage Sterndale recorded of Lieutenant-Colonel Boileau hunting a 12 feet tiger in 1861. Its hide is said to have measured 13 feet 5 inches. He also mentions Colonel Ramsay killing a 12 feet tiger.[27] There are many noted instances of tigers in India over 10 feet killed during British rule.[28] Loss of healthy gene-pool due to excessive hunting can be attributed to relatively smaller size of present day tigers. These big cats are in fact good swimmers. Tigers can endure thirst for substantial amount of time. In one instance recorded by British naturalist George P. Sanderson, two wounded tigers were caught in net during hot weather and they survived without water for 10 days.[12]: 379  Tigers cannot climb but the claw markings on the tree bark can be found up to a height of 10 feet.[12]: 380  Tigers are known to be cannibals and sometimes scavengers.[12]: 381 
        
        British Military Officer, Alexander Angus Airlie Kinloch, an enthusiastic tiger-hunter in his book published in 1885 observes
        
        It is rarely that tigers become man-eaters, probably on account of there being such abundance of game and cattle for them. Unless provoked, the tiger will rarely attack a man, but does his best to get away quickly.[29]
        
        Sir Samuel Baker, a Naturalist as well as a Big Game Hunter, revealed that it was rare for a tiger to attack any human being when suddenly and unexpectedly disturbed. He mentioned
        
        The truth is that the tiger seldom attacks to actually kill, unless it is driven, or wounded in a hunt. It will frequently charge with a short roar if suddenly disturbed, but it does not intend to charge home, and a shout from a native will be sufficient to turn it aside; it will then dash forward and disappear, probably as glad to lose sight of the man as he is at his escape from danger.[12]: 380 
        
        Mythology and Culture
        The Mahābhārata, an epic poem of ancient India's Sanskrit literature authored by Vyāsa, having originated in Vedic Period, consists of 18 parvas (books). The fifth Parva, Udyoga Parva, has 10 parts and 199 chapters. One of its shloka reads
        
        निर्वनो वध्यते व्याघ्रो निर्व्याघ्रं छिद्यते वनम् ।
        तस्माद्व्याघ्रो वनं रक्षेद्वनं व्याघ्रं च पालयेत् ॥
        nirvanō vadhyatē vyāghrō nirvyāghraṁ chidyatē vanam
        tasmādvyāghrō vanaṁ rakṣēdvanaṁ vyāghraṁ ca pālayēt.[30]
        
        which can be translated as
        
        Do not cut down that forest with its tigers! Let not the tigers be driven from that forest! There can be no forest without tigers, and no tigers without a forest. The forest shelters the tigers and tigers guard the forest![31]
        
        This philosophy holds true in present times as well. Tiger is admired and feared alike in Indian mythology. Goddess Shakti (Durga) rides on the tiger. Many deities across the country such as Dingu-Aneni (in North-East India),[32] Bonbibi (in West Bengal), Sabarimala Ayyappan (in Kerala), Huliraya (in Karnataka), Vaghdeo or Vaghoba (in Maharashtra)[33] and Chandraghanta[34]: 128  are associated and venerated with tiger. Puranas and folklore often mention tiger as vahana for many of the religious figures.[34] The Matsya Purana while narrating Shiva's marriage with Sati, describes some of the Ganas, the Shiva's attendants, having a face resembling that of a tiger.[34]: 102  Harivamsa Purana often uses qualities of a tiger as adjectives. [34]: 139 
        
        One Buddhist mythological tale suggest that Gautama Buddha in his past incarnation presented himself to a tigress as food when she was about to cannibalize her own cubs. This highlights compassion, the greatest virtue in Buddhist philosophy.[35] Taoism depicts tiger as one of its prominent element in its temples.[35]
        
        Tiger images can be seen in the cave paintings from mesolithic era found in the archaeological site of Bhimbetka rock shelters.[34]: 75  Tiger featured on the seals discovered in Mohenjodaro and Kalibangan shows its significance in the ancient Indus civilization and culture.[34]: 70  Earliest known pictorial depiction of Shiva wearing tiger skin are from Kushana Period.[34]: 167  Tiger holds religious and cultural significance for many adivasis in India. Kharia, Bhaina, Savar (or Saur), Parja tribes and Kusro sept in the state of Madhya Pradesh has totems of tiger.[34]: 24  Baigas consider tiger as their brother. Gonds are known for propitiating the tiger[34]: 26  as they see it as a protector.[34]: 262  Korku worships Baghdeo (Tiger God).[34]: 128  For the Murias, Chitan Deo (Tiger God) is the god of good hunting. Bhagashwar (Tiger God) is worshiped by the Bharias with a belief that they won't be killed by a tiger. Koyas people consider Konarzu as their Tiger God.[34]: 288  It is a well known fact that tribal people who share their lands with this top predator abstain from killing them as they consider it to be sacred.[34]: 262  Traditionally, India has always had a culture of conserving forests and the wildlife in its nature.[25]
        
        Hunting of tigers by Islamic Invaders can be traced back to the Mughal cultural links with Mongol and Timurid ancestry which practiced hunting of big cats (lions, in their region) as a ritual "to formalise any kind of authority" and considered killing them as a good omen for the kingdom. Conversely, if the hunting was unsuccessful and the animal escaped, it would invite trouble for the kingdom.[36]
        
        Foreign naturalists identified that tigers were regarded by the natives with a divine awe which prevented its killing by locals, even when they had power.[12]: 386  European religious magazines and publications played crucial role for introducing tigers to their youth and children.[37] While promptly acknowledging being unknown to this "terrific animal" which was "not an inhabitant of bible land",[37]: 76  English missionaries when passing through jungles "for the purpose of preaching the gospel to, and distributing religious books, among the poor benighted heathen" often encountered what they called "most savage and destructive of animals". On confronting this big cat, many a times they would lose the life of their fellow missionaries.[37]: 18  Then would ask to the readers back in their country
        
        What do you think it was? Why, it was the body of the poor man who had been killed. ... It was, indeed, a horrid and painful sight, and one which I shall never forget. On looking at it my blood seems to curdle in my veins. ... Youthful reader, did you ever feel thankful that you were born in a country where you are not in danger of being killed and eaten by those cruel and blood thirsty beasts?[37]: 19 </pre>
