        <p>Tigers in India constitute more than 70% of the global population of tigers.[1][2] Tiger is officially adopted as the National Animal of India[3] on recommendation of the National Board for Wildlife[4] since April 1972.[5] In popular local languages, tigers are called baagh, puli or sher.[6] The Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris [NCBI:txid74535])[7] is the species found all across the country except Thar desert region, Punjab and Kutch region.[8] These can attain the largest body size among all the Felidae,[6]: 29  and therefore are called Royal Bengal Tigers. Skin hides measuring up to 4 meters are recorded.[9] The body length measured from its nose to the tip of the tail can reach up to 3 meter and it can weigh up to 280 Kilogram with male being heavier than the female. The average life expectancy is about 15 years.[10] However, they are known to survive for up to 20 years in wild.[11] It is solitary and territorial. Tigers in India usually hunts chital (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), barasingha (Cervus duvacelii), wild buffalo (Bubalis arnee) nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and gaur (Bos gaurus) and other animals such as the wild pig (Sus scrofa) for prey and sometimes even other predators like leopards and bears.[10] There are instances of Elephant calves (Elephas maximus) hunted by tigers.[12]</p>

        <p>The tiger is estimated to have been present in India since the Late Pleistocene, for about 12,000 to 16,500 years.[13][14][15] Tigers are found in 20 states[16] of India with a variety of habitats including grasslands, mangrove swamps, tropical and sub-tropical forests,[10] as well as shola forest systems and from plains to mountains over 6000 feet.[17] The tiger is classified as Endangered in the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species.[18] Tigers throughout the Asia are found across 12 regional tiger conservation landscapes (TCLs), of which India is home to 6 global priority TCLs for long-term tiger conservation significance which harbors more than 60% of the global genetic variation in the tiger species.[17]: 6

        <p>platform of Tiger Range Countries – Global Tiger Forum[19]: 4  headquartered in New Delhi.[20]: 5  With a global share of 17% human population and 18% livestock population within 2.4% land area of the world, India has successfully managed to conserve the single largest population of free ranging wild tigers in the world effectively trying to reverse a century of decline.[19]: 2  Several initiatives in the form of amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, creating the "National Tiger Conservation Authority", delineating inviolate Core Areas in Tiger Reserves and incentivised voluntary relocation program, among many others have been critical in securing the survival of key tiger populations, the biodiversity, and the ecosystem services of the forests they inhabit.[21] The Project Tiger Division under Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is dedicated for conservation efforts in a scientific way using advanced technological tools.[22] The Government of India increased the budget allocation for tiger conservation from INR 185 crore in 2014 to INR 300 crore in 2022.[19]: 3 . India is committed to secure the livelihoods of its citizens while simultaneously minimizing its impact on its wildlife conservation goals.[21] In 2022, 54th tiger reserve in India was declared in Ranipur Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttar Pradesh, it being the State's fourth tiger reserve.[23]
            
            Tigers are present in different landscapes across the country.</p>
