        <h2>CHILD SELECTOR</h2>
        <P>To create a CSS child selector, you use two selectors. The child combinator selects elements that match the second selector and are the direct children of the first selector. Operators make it easier to find elements that you want to style with CSS properties. The CSS child selector has two selectors separated by a > symbol.</P><hr>
